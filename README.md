#YTDownload -- Make sure you have PYTUBE installed.

**A youtube downloader that downloads playlists in their audio formats only, so it's better for music.**
Pretty  nifty if you freuently stream songs from youtube and save them in youtube a playlist. 
All you need is the playlist link and the downloader handles the rest!
Really beats having to use those sketchy downloader sites.

The downloads are all kept in individual playlist folders titled by the playlist name.
If you like moving songs to another device ike your phone, a New_Arrivals folder is present in every playlist that collects every new download temporarily to make it easier to only transfer the new songs.
It makes it easier to prevent moving duplicates.
The downloader also skips already downloaded songs . 
Maybe more features will be added down the line.
