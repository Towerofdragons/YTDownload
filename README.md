# YTDownload -- Make sure you have the PYTUBE module installed!

(The code is kind of dirty but.... it works. Don't think about it too much.)

**A youtube downloader that downloads playlists in their audio formats only, so it's better for music.**

Pretty nifty if you frequently stream songs from youtube and save them in a youtube playlist... like me.
All you need is the playlist link and the downloader handles the rest!
Really beats having to use those sketchy downloader sites.

The downloads are all kept in individual playlist folders titled by the playlist name that are created automatically.
If you like moving songs to other devices like your phone, a New_Arrivals folder is present in every playlist. It holds every new download temporarily to make it easier to only transfer the new songs.
Meanwhile all downloads exist in the playlist folder.
The downloader also skips already downloaded songs. 
Maybe, more features will be added down the line... maybe.
